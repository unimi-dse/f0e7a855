\description{
This function creates a pie chart representing the precentual frequency of safe airlines, according to
the fatal accidents rate: note that the null observations come from 0/0 fatal accidents rate, so the safe airlines
are actually the 67.9% of the total airlines.
Note: this function requires the prepare function.
